This is an insult generator
==========================
**This code is for you if:**
- you work in a hostile enviornment and need a quick comeback
- you just got bitten by your parrot for the 1 millionth time
- you lack basic imagination, but rolled a bard in dnd anyways



How does it work?
----------------

Every time the program is run it logs a new, randomly generated insult.


### The message cosists of:
1. a target of the insult

    ex. "You" or "Your mother"
2. a verb or an action

    ex. is/are, wants to be.
    This should adjust to the object so that the grammer is correct.
3. an adjective (including the correct pretence)

    ex "an ugly" or "an uneducated"
    to give some punch
4. an object

    ex "horse"
    *currently doesnt work with plurals*

### Example Message:
> Your mother is an uneducated potato.



This code is made as a solution to the CodeCademy.com protfolio project: *mixed messages*
